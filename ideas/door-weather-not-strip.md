# Door weather not strip

## Problem being solved
Poorly installed/quality doors/frames cause gaps that make temperature control in the house more difficult/costly.

## Brainstorm
Door weather stripping is usually a tape that may need to be thicker in some places and not others, depending on how well the frame was installed.

Solution is a liquid-based sealer. There's a sack that is attached around the door so it bulges more when the door is open but makes the door airtight when the door is closed and pushes the liquid in the sack into a reservoir that inflates when the door is closed (excess liquid is pushed into it) and deflated (excess flows out to fill lower part of sacks on door due to gravity.

Cons:
* More effort to close the door because the closer needs to pull against the liquid pushing out to close the door completely
	* Could be solved by having the liquid remain in the reservoir until the door is fully closed and exiting the reservoir to fill the gaps once closed. But then how does the liquid reenter the reservoir? Ideally there would be no electronics
* Water conducts head better than air so there needs to be some other liquid in the sack that's easy/cheap to acquire/synthesize
