_Peopleware: productive projects and teams_ - Tom DeMarco

Likely useful for managing people and projects, which I need to learn how to do because I like succeeding and being efficient.

---

_Code complete 2_ - Steve McConnell

---

_Designing web usability_ - Jakob Nielsen

---

_Pragmatic programmer: from journeyman to master_ - Andrew Hunt

---

_Visual display of quantitative information_ - Edward Tufte

---

_About face: the essentials of interaction design_ - Alan Cooper

---

_Don't make me think_ - Steve Krug

---

_The annotated Turing: A guided tour through Alan Turing's historic paper on computability and the Turing Machine_ - Charles Petzold

"Uncle Bob" recommends the book in his talks, and I enjoy his point of view, so I'd like to see if I glean some of what he did.

---

_Ideas and opinions_ - Albert Einstein

A collection of ideas and opinions by a great man.

---

_Wheel of time series_ - Robert Jordan

Recommended by friends as a (long but) amazing series with interesting magic system. An author I like, Brandon Sanderson, took up writing up the remainder of the series after Robert Jordan passed so I am interested in seeing what an author I like saw in the series.

---

* _Xenogenesis series_ - Octavia E. Butler
* _Woven in moonlight_ - Isabel Ibañez
* _Pushing ice_ - Alastair Reynolds
* _Falling Kingdoms series_ - Morgan Rhodes, Michelle Rowen

Recommended by an author I met on a plane somewhere (sorry I can't remember :/)

I feel like Isabel was the author that I met, but I'm not sure.

_Cryopaedia_ - Xenophon

"Xenophon, like Plato, was a student of Socrates. For whatever reason, his work is not nearly as famous, even though it is far more applicable. Unlike Plato, Xenophon studied people. His greatest book is about the latter, it’s the best biography written of Cyrus the Great (aka the father of human rights). There are so many great lessons in here and I wish more people would read it. Machiavelli learned them, as this book inspired The Prince." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

I haven't read _The Prince_ but I'd like to find out who Cyrus the Great was and what lessons Mr. Holiday saw.

_The Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus: A Roman Slave_ - Publius Syrus

"The best philosophy comes from people who were not “philosophers.” Syrus was a slave and his moral maxims are far better than perhaps the most famous book in this category, those of Duc de la Rochefoucauld. Some favorites: “The mightiest rivers are easy to cross at their source.” “Avarice is the source of its owns sorrows.” And of course, extra-applicable to this list, “Many receive advice, few profit by it.”" - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

I'd tend to agree that those subjected to a system have more insight than those that muse about it without any experience. I'm interested in reading what moral maxims Syrus had, since I, myself, am trying to find some good rules to live by other than the general "Golden Rule".

_The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects_ - Giorgio Vasari

"Basically a friend and peer of Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael Titian and all the other great minds of the Renaissance sat down in 1550 and wrote biographical sketches of the people he knew or had influenced him. Unless you have a degree in Art History it’s unlikely that anyone pushed this book at you and that’s a shame. Because these great men were not just artist, they were masters of the political and social worlds they lived in. There are so many great lessons about craft and psychology within this book. The best part? It was written by someone who actually knew what he was talking about, not some art snob or critic, but an actual artist and architect of equal stature to the people he was documenting." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

I wasn't aware that Michelangelo or Da Vinci were involved in politics of their time, and it'd be interesting to read how they were involved and who Raphael Titian is.

_12 Years A Slave_ - Solomon Northup

"This one won’t stay unknown for long as Brad Pitt’s doing a movie about it but please don’t let that scare you away. If there is one book you read about slavery in America, read this one. It’s the real story of a born freedman in the North who, as a traveling musician, was brought out of his home state on false pretenses in order to be captured, kidnapped, and transported South to be sold as a slave. It’s fucking harrowing and written lucidly and articulately by the person who experienced it. For 12 years, he was a slave–and not some border-state slave, but a bayou slave in the deep South. He was cut off from his family and his freedom, and even among the slaves he was different. He couldn’t tell anyone he could read and write, he couldn’t even tell anyone that he was formerly free because they threatened to kill him if he did. This book is just as good as Frederick Douglass’ memoir and I think illustrates the horrors of slavery in a much more undeniable way." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

The insight of someone who has seen slavery from the outside in the North and then thrust into the thick of slavery in the South seems like it'd be one of the best ways to get a window into the period of slavery in America.

_Forty Years a Gambler on the Mississippi_ - George Devol

"The memoir of a professional gambler, fighter and criminal who rode the riverboats of the Mississippi and Red Rivers. It’s a true and vibrant snapshot of a period of American life that you can’t get anywhere else. Gun fights, brawls, cons–it’s all here. Fascinating, peculiar and very easy to read." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

I normally wouldn't care about the life of a gambler/fighter/criminal but part of personal growth is to learn from others. As such, I want to see what kind of life Mr. Devol lived and what lessons I can take from his life and apply to mine.

_Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to His Son_ - George Horace Lorimer

"This book is the preserved correspondence between Old Gorgon Graham, a self-made millionaire in Chicago, and his son who is coming of age and entering the family business. The letters date back to the 1890s but feel like they could have been written in any era. Honest. Genuine. Packed with good advice." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

Letters to your children, if written in earnest, yield such wealth because it's a direct transfer of knowledge between generations that have such intimate knowledge of each other -- that's what I hope, at least. I'd like to see what kind of help I can glean from a man writing to his son, in which, if I were in such a circumstance, I would pass as much knowledge as I could to prepare my child for the future and give him a leg up.

_Company K_ - William March

"Far and away the best book ever written about WWI. Better than All Quiet on the Western Front or Goodbye to All That or any of the other classics. But that’s the problem–WWI was awful, perhaps the most awful thing of the 21st century. And this book is forgotten precisely because it portrays the war and its pointlessness too realistically. We want to know, but we don’t really want to know." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

The more real, the better.

_Why Don’t We Learn from History?_ - BH Liddell Hart
_Strategy_ - BH Liddell Hart

"These are two very short books but will help you understand the topics more than thousands of pages on the same topic by countless other writers. In my view, Hart is unquestionably the best writer on military strategy and history. Better than von Clausewitz, that’s for sure (who for all the talk is basically useless unless you are planning on fighting Napoleon). His theories on the indirect approach is life changing, whether you’re struggling with a business or just office politics. I can’t say much more than read these books. It’s a must." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

The title, _Why Don't We Learn from History?_, did it for me. I hadn't even read Mr. Holiday's suggestion before I wanted to read the book. Why did it hit so hard? Because I feel that people get too comfortable and forget the reality of living among humans, myself included. The reality that people will do terrible things given enough time and ignoring -- or more accurately, forgetting -- the signs that appear time and time again prolong suffering and hold humanity back.

_The Crack Up_ - F. Scott Fitzgerald

"If you like Asylum, read The Crack Up, a book put together by Fitzgerald’s friend Edmund Wilson after his death. It is such an honest and self-aware compilation of someone hell-bent on their own destruction. At the same time, Fitzgerald’s notes and story ideas within the book make it undeniably clear what a genius he truly was. It’s a sad and moving but necessary read." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

Having read _The Great Gatsby_ in high school, I'm not too excited to read about Mr. Fitzgerald's thoughts; the writing and style didn't really appeal to me. But, hey, if so many people find his work to be great and there's a window into his mind, I want to see what's going on.

_Death Be Not Proud_ - John Gunther

"Written in 1949 by the famous journalist John Gunther about his death of his son, a genius, at 17 from a brain tumor, this book is deeply moving and profound. Every young person will be awed by this young boy who knows he will die too soon and struggles to do it with dignity and purpose. Midway through the book, Johnny writes what he calls the Unbeliever’s Prayer. It’s good enough to be from Epictetus or Montaigne–and he was fucking 16 when he wrote it. It’s reading the book for that alone." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

The book's title and _Unbeliever's Prayer_ sound really familiar. Regardless, I've started to see time as a silent death as well and want to understand the son's perspective on such a commonly squandered resource.

---

_Losing the War_ - Lee Sandlin

"This is an essay, not a book, but if you have to read one thing about WWII, this is it. Sandlin is a master and the essay is free, [read it](http://leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm)." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

I'll give it a shot, I guess.

_The Measure of My Days_ - Florida Scott Maxwell

"The daily notes of a strong but dying woman (born 1883, written in 1968) watching her life slowly leave her and wind to a close. The wisdom in this thing is amazing and the fact that most people have no idea exists–and basically wait until the end of their life to start thinking about all this is very sad to me. Also I love her generation–alive during the time of Wyatt Earp yet lived to see man land on the moon. What an insane period of history." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

Seeing the end makes some panic and some surrender. In Ms. Maxwell's case, it seems like she makes the most of it by imparting wisdom on paper.

---

_The Power Tactics of Jesus Christ and Other Essays_ - Jay Haley

"The title essay in this book is peerless and amazing. The rest of the essays, which talk about Haley’s unusual approach to psychotherapy are also quite good. If you’ve gone to therapy, are thinking about going to therapy, or know someone going to therapy, this book is a must-read." - [Ryan Holiday](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/07/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/)

I'm under none of those categories, but I enjoy reading about psychology.

_Kitchen Confidential_ - Anthony Bourdain

"It shows the raw bits of what it's like to work in the kitchen." - Chris
