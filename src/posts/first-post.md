I've been wanting to make a site for a while now; somewhere to store my ideas and have them available to the world. Somewhere I owned (to more of an extent).

I tinkered with making my own site framework in my early iteration of the supreme-enigma repo. It was a full node server that server pages by dynamically rendering pages per request and rendering these articles via Markdown plugin... but that was a lot of overhead for a simple site that I wanted.

I trashed that custom framework and went with using [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) for the framework and [Pug](https://pugjs.org) as the template engine. The initial setup has been mostly learning the framework, but that was quick and now it's all about customizing the presentation. It's exactly what I wanted. Low maintenance. Easy. Like me :)

Let's see where this takes me.
