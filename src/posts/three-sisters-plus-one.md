The [Three Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_%28agriculture%29) system in agriculture looked interesting because of its efficiency via companion planting. Here's a summary of how the plants work together:

> The maize provides a structure for the beans to climb, eliminating the need for poles. The beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use, and the squash spreads along the ground, blocking the sunlight, helping prevent the establishment of weeds. The squash leaves also act as a "living mulch", creating a microclimate to retain moisture in the soil, and the prickly hairs of the vine deter pests. &ndash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_%28agriculture%29)

# The plan

This is what's being planted:
* [Ferry Morse, sweet corn, Early Golden Bantam](https://ferrymorse.com/products/sweet-corn-early-golden-bantam-hybrid)
* [Burpee, pole bean, Kentucky Wonder](https://www.burpee.com/vegetables/beans/bean-pole-kentucky-wonder-prod000588.html)
* Burpee, nasturtium, Fordhook Favorites Mixed Colors
* [Burpee, summer squash, Early Summer Crookneck](https://www.burpee.com/vegetables/squash/squash-early-summer-crookneck-prod000911.html)

Everything is going to be planted in a 210 cm square measured in sections every 15 cm because it's a common denominator to the planting spacing for the corn, squash, beans, and nasturtium.

The above design was inspired by [hortophile's garden](https://hortophile.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/my-three-sisters-garden/) with regard to the spacing of the corn and squash. Unfortunately, the beans planting locations are not visible and resulted in guessing as to where those would go.

Each row of corn are on mounds ~30 cm high and 45 cm wide with soaker hoses running along the top of the mounds in the row. This means three hoses for the diagram above running north-south.

Like Wikipedia suggests, the corn is started first and then starting the squash, beans, and nasturtium after the corn is ~15 cm high.

Notes:
* The tops and bottom corn stalks use nasturtium instead of beans to deter pests.

Things to check on as it grows:
* Beans surround some corn stalks. Not sure if this will strangle it or not.
* Hoping that the beans and nasturtium don't compete for corn stalks.

The mound method mentioned in the Wikipedia article isn't being done because there isn't clear enough direction on how the mound is set up. Is it a cylindrical mound? How is it growing 3 corn stalks if corn stalks need to be 30 cm apart? Etc.
