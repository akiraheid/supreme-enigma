title: Growing carrots
---

It was recommended not to transplant carrots by [Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/home-garden/gardening/planting-vegetables-from-seed-and-seedling/) and implied by [Morning Chores](https://morningchores.com/growing-corn/), but I grew carrot seed in plastic seed pods outside and had no trouble transplanting them. None died and the smaller ones I tossed aside actually grew where I tossed them. Unfortunately I don't remember what breed the carrot was.

The only downside I saw was that the carrots didn't grow down and grew sideways, seemingly stunting their growth. Perhaps this is the reason why.
