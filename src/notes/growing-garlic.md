title: Growing garlic

Bought garlic from the store works, but ideally get garlic known to grow well in the area.

# How to plant
## Considerations
* garlic takes 8 months to grow<sup>1</sup>, so plant somewhere that won't be used
* plant in late September-November<sup>1, 2</sup>
	* given it takes ~8 months to mature, developing leaves being the start before the bulb forms, planting in spring produces lower yields because leafing has to occur and, when that has completed, the bulb won't be growing during periods of high temperatures as it prefers<sup>1, 3</sup>
* 6+ hours sun<sup>1</sup>
* well-drained, loose soil<sup>1, 2</sup>
* don't plant where members of the same (onion) family has been grown recently<sup>1</sup>
	* at least 3 seasons

## Soil prep
* depth of 15 cm of loose soil, ideally lots of organic matter<sup>1</sup>
* remove all weeds
* remove stones from top 15 cm of soil
* fertilize with potassium and phosphorus necessary for 10-10-10<sup>1</sup>
	* nitrogen is only 1/3 of recommended amount<sup>1</sup>

## Planting
* space garlic 15 cm apart, rows spaced 30 cm apart, 6 cm deep<sup>1</sup>
* plant clove's pointed end up<sup>1</sup>
* plant large cloves<sup>1</sup>

# Care
## Watering
* water once a week when leaves start to appear and soak soil to a depth of 3 cm<sup>1</sup>

## Maintenance
* when plant is 15 cm tall, topdress with 2/3 recommended nitrogen (blood meal) for each plant<sup>1</sup>
* cut off any flowering stalks to have plant focus energy on bulb<sup>1</sup>
* layer with mulch (spaced 5 cm away from stem) to prevent weed growth<sup>1</sup>
* once garlic stops producing new leaves, remove mulch and stop watering and let the bulbs dry out<sup>3</sup>
* garlic competes poorly when young so weed often<sup>1</sup>

# Harvest
* harvest when half of the leaves turn brown and start to fall over<sup>1, 2</sup>
* dig up the bulbs carefully and do not pull up by the stem<sup>1</sup>

# Storage
* lay them out for 72 hours in an area with good air circulation and no direct sunlight to dry the bulbs out<sup>1, 3</sup>
* when the bulbs are dry, clean off the dirt and roots
* braid or tie leaves together and store in a well-ventilated, dark, dry area that does not fluctuate temperature dramatically<sup>1</sup>
	* light may trigger growth<sup>1</sup>
* storing the the fridge is not recommended<sup>1</sup>
* use any that start to sprout
