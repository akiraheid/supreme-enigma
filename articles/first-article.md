# This is my first article!

This is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) but does it show up as Markdown?! I'd hope not (if it does, please let me know because it's not supposed to be).

I'm using a Markdown filter in [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) to convert this text document into HTML without more work on my part. Thank you, Pug!

Why do I have my articles as text files instead of in a MySQL database? Currently, my site's pretty small and I don't want to deal with running databases and managing a connection with my minimal website. As it grows, perhaps I'll switch over, but file I/O is good enough right now.

Using files also has an added benefit: I can store the articles themselves with the website and I can also back them up for free with Git to have a history for the article built in!
